# PPRL via Bilinear Mapping
We propose a simple yet effective Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL). \n
Due to its considerable computation burden, we use the blocking mechanism to reduce the computation time. \n
To demonstrate the feasibility and efﬁciency of the proposed PPRL, \n
we optimize and perform a prototype implementation to show the improved efﬁciency by taking advantage of CUDA GPU speedup.
