# PPRL via Bilinear Mapping
#We propose a simple yet effective Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL). 
#Due to its considerable computation burden, we use the blocking mechanism to reduce the computation time. 
#To demonstrate the feasibility and efﬁciency of the proposed PPRL, 
#we optimize and perform a prototype implementation to show the improved efﬁciency by taking advantage of CUDA GPU speedup.
